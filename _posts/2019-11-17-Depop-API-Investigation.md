## Depop?
Depop is an online marketplace app designed to mimic the look-and-feel of Instagram 
where individuals and businesses sell anything they want. The app services many 
people with growth happening exponentially. 

Because of the nature of online marketplaces, automation is a crucial part of many
businesses' workflows in an effort to minimize the amount of manual work required
to list 100s of products on to different platforms. Depop is one of the more obtuse
platforms in that you can only manage listings from the app itself probably to
directly copy the instagram model
