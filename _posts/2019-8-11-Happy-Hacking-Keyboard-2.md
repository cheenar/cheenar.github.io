title: (Review) Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2

### TL;DR
Great keyboard that feels like a rigid membrane keyboard that I used to use back in K-12 education and that makes me a very effective typist on it. Would recommend if you are able to afford the $250 price tag like it's nothing. 

Honestly, an HP membrane keyboard from the library is just as good to me, in a getting-things-done sense, so make sure you know what you want first. I plan on using this keyboard for probably next 2-3 years really unless I get the itch to make my own.

Wow. Just wow. I cannot believe I was in the mindspace to drop $250 on a pre-built keyboard but here we are. This is the HHKB Pro2, a topre keyboard with a unique layout that favors Unix users and is one of *those* keyboards. If you see someone with this, you already know they mean business, or just like wasting money. 

I have been shuffling through a couple of keyboards, namely the Vortex Core, Ducky MIYA Panda, and an AUKEY that I threw my own custom keycaps on. Before that, I have been using a Razer Blackwidow and Logitech G5XX, both are decent keyboards for their prices in my opinon, but if you read /r/mechanicalkeyboards you'll probably be laughed at for ever considering those as viable 'boards.

My desire to get a HHKB came from my bad experience with my Vortex Core. I really like it. I really want to like it. But I cannot program effectively on it. Using the {}, (), and ;'" keys all require some level of keyboard-jitsu to effectively hit, not to mention all of the symbols and numbers are hidden behind multiple layer keys. I think that it being a fully-programmable keyboard that's built all in hardware and requires no software to work is pretty impressive, but give me a slightly bigger board please.

However, this is my own fault. I use a Vortex Race3 quite a bit and it seems like the answer to me: a more usable Core. But, I appreciate the save saving of the Core, I really really appreciate. But, I wanted to try something other than a Race3 since it was kind of plain to me. 

That brought me to the HHKB. It had all the keys I needed for the most part (a tenkeyless model would be much apprecaited however) and had "topre" switches. How exciting? 

After some internet searching, it became apparent that topre switches are not like any other mechanical switch I was used to using or hearing about. They use a mechanical interface to actuate a piece of rubber to charge a capacitive plate. Here is a great overview of the switch and a sound-test <a href="https://www.keychatter.com/topre-switches/">Key Chatter</a>.

### Review (5/5)

* Size: 4/5
* Layout: 5/5
* Typing Feel: 5/5

The typing feel is great. These definitely had the right amount of resistence. If you're someone looking for a key that feels harder to press, I feel like topre has something that makes it feel heavier than its 45g actuation rating. The thock sound is not as apparent to me while typing but it definitely does not have the loud clickyness of a MX Blues or the same sound that comes from MX Browns. Really, this is a personal preference thing so you just have to get used it.

The layout is a bit weird. At first I was having difficultly pressing the backspace because of it's placement on the same row as the [] keys but after some practice I am hitting the backspace properly and now struggle to hit it on normal keyboards. The backspace position actually makes a lot more sense to me, I can reach it with less movement than the normal ANSI layout. 

The decision to move the ` and ~ keys to the right is a bit weird to me and I still make mistakes. I'm sure that it will come with practice since both of those keys are a bit rare for me to use but I can easily say that this layout will not require any jitsu to use like the Core or other smaller layouts. 

The size is great. It's not as small as the core, but nothing really is. However, it's definitely a board that I can use comfortably and have no problem bringing it with me around in a carrying case.
