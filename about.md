Currently a Student studying Data Science & Automated Scraping Systems at the University of California, Berkeley. My interests include the automation of data analytics and data acquisition. 

I am currently a UC Berkeley URAP Fellow under the Agricultural Resources & Economics department for the Summer of 2019. My research team has recently published a sports analytics paper through the MIT Sloan Sports conference this past year.
